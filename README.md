## Introduction

SEMAUTO is a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder Neural Network which exploits knowledge encoded in a Knowledge Graph in order to build an Autoencoder whose topology reflects connections in the KG to weigh features related to rated items to build an explicit representation of the user profile.

## Configuration

## Evaluation

We used the well know [RankSys](https://github.com/RankSys/RankSys) Java library to evaluate our recommendations.

## Results
